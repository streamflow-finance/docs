# Roadmap

## Vision

To fuel the crypto adoption by helping organizations with their token operations.

## Mission

Streamflow helps organizations streamline their token operations so they can focus on the core business.

We do so by helping organizations design, launch, and distribute tokens, and align their token stakeholders' interests with vesting schedules, customizable distribution mechanisms, and tailored compensation planning, among other things.

We help investors track and manage their (vested) token portfolio easily across chains and services.
