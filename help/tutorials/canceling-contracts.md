# 💰 Canceling Contracts

Depending on the permissions granted while creating the vesting contract or payroll stream, the sender/recipient might get an option to cancel the vesting or payroll contract.\
\
When a vesting contract or payroll stream is canceled, the amount that has not been unlocked yet is returned to the sender, whereas the unlocked amount is automatically withdrawn into the recipient's wallet.\
\
Please keep in mind that you will have to click on the three dots (...) right below the 'actions' heading to see the options to interact with the vesting or payroll contract.

You just have to click on the cancel button and approve the transaction in your wallet. Once a contract has been canceled, you will be able to see the amount that has been returned to the sender and the number of tokens that have been withdrawn into the recipient's wallet.
