#### Auto-claim tokens to your wallet

With **Auto-Claim** you can automate the need for the recipient to claim their tokens as they unlock. Instead the unlocked tokens are directly dropped into the recipients wallet. The sender will pay the fees for these transactions.&#x20;

_Please note:_ If the recipient's wallet address belongs to a centralized exchange, it is mandatory to activate Auto-Claim.&#x20;
