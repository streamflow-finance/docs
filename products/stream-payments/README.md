Streamflow payroll streams come up with unique and configurable features that bring a ton of benefits for both the employer and the employees for example: set the contracts to be cancellable for the sender, transferrable for the recipient and activate automatic claim (the streamed tokens are automatically dropped into the recipients wallet).

It saves you time and money by making the whole payroll system bankless and paperless, you only need a decentralized wallet account, funds, and the wallet addresses of employees to set up payroll streams.
