When the sender is creating the vesting or payment contract, they can optionally configure permission for the recipient to update the recipient address that all scheduled tokens will unlock to.&#x20;

_Please note:_ This can be reconfigured while the contract is active as well. &#x20;

The transfer option can be useful both for changing the wallet address of the existing recipient or transferring a vesting contract or payment contract to a completely new recipient.\
\
:exclamation:**Important:** When a vesting contract or payment contract is transferred, the contract gets transferred to the new address with both the locked amount (scheduled tokens) as well as the **unlocked tokens that have not been withdrawn** by the previous recipient.

To transfer the contract to a new recipient address, follow the steps below.

**Step 1:** Visit the Streamflow app and select either **"Vesting"** or **"Payments"** &#x20;

**Step 2:** Here you will see your contract/s. Click on the drop down menu on the right, three action buttons (...) to see the transfer option.

**Step 3:** Once in the contract details page, you'll see you're available actions at the top right of the page. Click **"Transfer"**.

**Step 4:** Drop the **exact wallet address** that you would like to reconfigure the contract to progressively unlock tokens to. _Note: The address must be a wallet address on the same blockchain (Ethereum L1, BNB etc.)._
