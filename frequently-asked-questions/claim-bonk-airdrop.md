**Additional guidelines to avoid potential errors:**

* When connecting your Twitter account, we've noticed that the Twitter API gives you about 15-30 seconds to confirm otherwise it will error. So just a tip to use fast internet and confirm immediately
* You Twitter account must be a public account with a #bonk tweet in last 7 days
* Make sure to allow cookies on Streamflow

* 1 user (user = Twitter & discord account) can withdraw a Bonk token for 1 contract created to a single wallet. If you received more than one contract to the same/different wallet from Bonk, you will not be able to use the same Twitter/discord to withdraw that second contract sent to that different/same wallet address
* If you try to create new Twitter/discord accounts to withdraw Bonk tokens for that second received the contract to same/different wallet address, that Twitter accounts needs to be created before May 2023 (when airdrop happened), otherwise, the withdrawal will not work
* If you are constantly switching between Twitter/Discord, caching issues may occur and withdrawal might fail. Please make sure to clear the cache and cookies on your browser after every switching between Twitter accounts.

* If you do not find any contract on the vesting tab, that means no stream was created for your wallet by the BONK team, so you can reach out to them
* If using Phantom and see a caution message, click on ignore the warning and proceed anyway.
