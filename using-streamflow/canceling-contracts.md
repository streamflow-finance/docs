When the sender is creating a vesting or payment contract, they can optionally configure permission for either the **sender** or **recipient** to cancel the contract.&#x20;

_Please note:_ Cancellation can occur both when the contract is scheduled, as well as when it is active.  \

:exclamation:**Important:** When a vesting contract or payment contract is cancelled, all tokens which have not yet vested (locked) are **automatically returned to the sender** who created the contract whereas the unlocked amount is automatically withdrawn into the recipient's wallet.

To cancel a contract, follow the steps below.

**Step 1:** Visit the Streamflow app and select either **"Vesting"** or **"Payments"** &#x20;
