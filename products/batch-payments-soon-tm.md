# Batch payments (CSV Upload)

You can create streams in bulk using Streamflow, it's incorporated into the main flow for token vesting and streaming payments either by manually adding additional recipients or by CSV upload.&#x20;

**Manual recipients**

In order to send to multiple recipients, you can either click "Add recipient" until you have the number of recipients you require.&#x20;

**CSV Upload**

Alternatively, if you are looking to set up streams or vesting contracts for many recipients, you can alternatively make use of our CSV upload feature.&#x20;
