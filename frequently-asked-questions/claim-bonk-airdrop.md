Before you start the process, make sure to have at least 0.1 BONK tokens on your wallet and enough SOL to cover gas fees\
\
**Step 1:** Connect the wallet to [https://app.streamflow.finance/](https://app.streamflow.finance/)\

**Step 4:** Once you click on the withdraw option, you will be asked to check the box for legal compliance and connect your Discord and Twitter accounts, please note that your Twitter account must be older than May 2023 as per the criteria set by the BONK team. Your internet connection needs to be fast enough to connect and verify Twitter in less than 30 seconds to avoid authentication issue

Also, make sure you have joined BONK Discord and you have followed @bonk\_inu on Twitter and also Tweet with #bonk to complete all KYC steps

**Additional guidelines to avoid potential errors:**

* 1 user (user = Twitter and Discord account) can withdraw Bonk tokens from 1 airdrop contract created to a single wallet. If you received more than one contract to the same/different wallet from Bonk, you will not be able to use the same Twitter/Discord to withdraw that second contract. These were the rules that were provided by the Bonk team. If you run into issues here, please try to remove the cookie in your browser and reconnect the original wallet and socials.&#x20;
* Please make sure to clear cache and cookies on your browser after switching between for example Twitter accounts.&#x20;
* Make sure you have at least 0.1 BONK in your wallet from which you are trying to make a withdrawal. If you have revoked your token account for BONK, you will not be able to withdraw. Sending BONK to the wallet will create a new token account.&#x20;
* If using Phantom and you see a caution message, click on "ignore warning" and proceed.
* In case you are on the list of recipients but do not see an airdrop in Streamflow when you connect your wallet - please check with the Bonk team.&#x20;
