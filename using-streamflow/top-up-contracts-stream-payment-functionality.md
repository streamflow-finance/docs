# Top up Payment Contract

The sender who creates the payment contract is able to optionally **top up the contract** while it is active. If the contract is topped up, the duration is **extended** based on the amount topped up and the release frequency.&#x20;

:thought\_balloon:Let's take a practical example, if you had a $7 payment with a duration of 1 week releasing tokens daily, and you topped up $3 then the contract would be extended for 3 additional days.&#x20;

This feature is **always** available to senders who have created a payment contract.\
\
_Note**:**_ It's not possible to extend a contract once it has completed.

To top up a contract, follow the steps below.

**Step 1:** Visit the Streamflow app and select **"Payments"** &#x20;
