# Batch payments

You can create streams in bulk using Streamflow, it's incorporated into the main flow for token vesting and streaming payments either by manually adding additional recipients or by CSV upload.&#x20;

**Manual recipients**

In order to send to multiple recipients you can either click "Add recipient" until you have the number of recipients you require.&#x20;

Alternatively, if you are looking to setup streams or vesting contracts for many recipients, you can alternatively make use of our CSV upload feature.&#x20;
