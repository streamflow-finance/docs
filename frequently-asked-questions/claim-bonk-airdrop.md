# Claim Bonk airdrop

We appreciate your patience as we are making some updates to make things run more smoothly for you.&#x20;

In the meantime, below are some tips and tricks for successfully claiming your airdrop.&#x20;

* 1 user (user = Twitter and Discord account) can withdraw Bonk tokens from 1 airdrop contract created to a single wallet. If you received more than one contract to same/different wallet from Bonk, you will not be able to use the same Twitter/Discord to withdraw that second contract. These were the rules that were provided by the Bonk team.&#x20;
* Please make sure to clear cache and cookies on your browser after switching between for example Twitter accounts.&#x20;
* Make sure you have at least 0.1 BONK in your wallet from which you are trying to make a withdrawal. If you have revoked your token account for BONK, you will not be able to withdraw. Sending BONK to the wallet will create a new token account.&#x20;
* If using Phantom and you see caution message, click on "ignore warning" and proceed.
* In case you are on the list of recipients but you do not see an airdrop in Streamflow when you connect your wallet - please check with the Bonk team.&#x20;
