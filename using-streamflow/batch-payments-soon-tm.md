# Batch Contracts with CSV

You can create contracts in bulk using Streamflow, it's incorporated into the main flow for token vesting and payment contracts either by manually adding additional recipients or by **CSV upload**. In this walkthrough we'll show how you can create up to between 60-300 **contracts at once using a simple CSV (wallet dependent)**.



**Step 1:** Visit the Streamflow app and select **"Vesting"** or **"Payments"**.

**Step 3:** Fill the contract out as shown in ["Create a Vesting Contract" ](token-vesting.md)and once you reach the second step in the creation flow you'll see **"Upload CSV"**
