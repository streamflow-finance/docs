# What is Streamflow?

**Streamflow** is a token operations platform allowing for programmable payments via token vesting, payroll, and other blockchain-based fund management techniques. By enabling organizations to handle their funds entirely on-chain, Streamflow helps teams cut costs, save time, and enhance transparency.&#x20;

Streamflow also maintains an [SDK](broken-reference) that allows teams to integrate 'streaming' capabilities into any app, allowing for the exploration of innovative value transfer and fund distribution methods.&#x20;

Streamflow aims to provide a diverse range of projects with access to payment infrastructure, and in achieving this, it is available for use on the following blockchains:

* Solana
* Ethereum
* Polygon
* Aptos&#x20;
* BNB Chain
* Sui
