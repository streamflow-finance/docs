# Multisig

Streamflowâ€™s multisig wallet is here and ready to serve individuals and teams looking to establish a treasury gated by multiple private keys.

For a detailed walkthrough to set up your first multisig with Streamflow you can find our tutorial [here](../help/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-multisig-beta-wallet.md).

Note: Multisig is only available on the Solana network for now.
