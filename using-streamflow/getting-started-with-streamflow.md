# Getting started with Streamflow

**Why do I have to sign a signature request when I connect to Streamflow?**

As part of our ongoing commitment to ensure both the security and functionality of your experience on Streamflow, we'd like to clarify why a signature request is required in addition to connecting your wallet.

**The Role of Wallet Connection**

Connecting your wallet to Streamflow is the first step in verifying your identity and accessing our services. It's like using a key to open a door — it gets you into the system. However, this step alone doesn't provide ongoing verification of your actions or intentions within the platform.

**Why a Signature Request is Essential**

A signature request goes a step further. Think of it as a way of giving us a 'nod' or confirmation for activities during your session. Here’s why it’s vital:

1. **Continuous Verification**: While your wallet connection gets you through the door, the signature request ensures that it's really you making the actions every step of the way.
2. **Operational Efficiency**: By signing once at the beginning of your session, we minimize the need for repeated verifications, making your experience smoother and more seamless.
3. **No Blockchain Transactions**: Importantly, this signature is not a blockchain transaction and incurs no cost. It's a simple, internal check for Streamflow to maintain the integrity and security of your session.

**Streamlining Your Experience**

Our goal is to blend security with ease of use. This process is designed to provide you with a secure, efficient, and user-friendly experience on Streamflow. We understand it might seem like an extra step, but it's a crucial one that keeps your session secure.
