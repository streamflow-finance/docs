Add members by copying and pasting their wallet addresses. Be sure to enter member names to keep track of which wallet belongs to which member.

**Step 4: Set the number of approvals needed for proposals**

Set the number of members needed to complete a transaction. For instance, if you have three members you can require two of those three to approve a transaction. You can also require one member or all three members to come together to approve a transaction depending on your needs.

**Step 6: Manage Multisig via proposals**

When you Initiate a stream, add a new member, or change the name of the multisig wallet an accompanying proposal is created. Members must vote on each proposal in order to make changes to the multisig wallet.
