# ðŸ’° Fees

**Service fees:** Streamflow charges 0.25% service fee on top of tokens deposited into vesting, payment or token lock contracts on all networks that we support.\
\
**Note:** we also offer custom fees in stable coins, please [book a call](https://calendly.com/streamflow-bd/discovery?month=2023-10) for custom fee offer.

**Network fees:** In addition to the Streamflow fees, standard network gas fees apply to transaction for creating or interacting with contracts.\
\
The gas fee required for creating contracts on Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Sui and Aptos is same as for making a swap on the given network.

For Solana, the complete breakdown for network fees is given below:

_(\*) This means that the fee is not fully unlocked upon stream creation, but it is gradually unlocked over the course of the stream._\
\
_It is important to mention that the fee is charged on top of the amount that is streamed, e.g. if 100 BTC is streamed, the sender account will be debited by 100.25 BTC._\
\_\_\
_(\*\*) Solana network charges storage rent for the account creation._\
_Rent is calculated per storage byte._\
\_\_\
_(\*\*\*) An escrow token account is created upon stream creation. When the recipient withdraws all of the tokens, the escrow account will be closed and rent will be sent to the Streamflow treasury account._
