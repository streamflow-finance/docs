Select either **instant** or **vested**.

**Instant:** Tokens can be scheduled to be airdropped in the future but when the airdrop happens it is instant and all tokens are distributed in one go.

**Vested:** Tokens are vested according to the configuration.

For this tutorial, we'll create an **instant airdrop**.

**Step 3: Upload a CSV or choose quick collections**

We allow you to upload as many CSVs as you like (below 30k total recipients) and/or easily choose quick collections to airdrop to.

**Step 4: Configure your airdrop**

Configure your airdrop by naming it, scheduling when it should take place and electing if it can be cancelled or not.

We've selected MadLads for the drop and we'll be dropping some $BONK to each unique MadLad holder.

The standard Streamflow fee for creating an Airdrop is 0.19%. Streamflow is added as an additional recipient to the airdrop and recieves the payment alongside the rest of the recipients.

For standard users we support up to 30k recipients per airdrop. For enterprise customers we can support up to 1 million recipients per airdrop.
