# Getting started with Streamflow (ledger)

As you embark on your journey with Streamflow, we want to ensure that you have a clear understanding of our security processes, specifically tailored for our Ledger users. Due to the current limitations in Ledger support for Solana, our procedure is slightly different for you.

**Why a Transaction Request Instead of a Signature?**

Normally, Streamflow users authenticate their session with a simple signature request. However, for Ledger users like yourself, the Solana platform currently doesn’t support this feature. As a workaround, we use a transaction request for authentication purposes.

**The Role of Transaction Request for Ledger Users**

1. **Your Authentication Key**: The transaction request serves as a unique key to verify your identity and authorize your session on Streamflow.
2. **One-time Action**: Just like the signature request, you only need to do this once, making your experience smooth while maintaining high security. Think of it like a cookie when you log into a website.&#x20;
3. **No Actual Transaction**: It’s important to note that this is not a real blockchain transaction. No assets will be moved, and it won’t incur any transaction fees. It's purely for session authentication.

**Streamflow’s Commitment to Ledger Users**

We understand that this extra step might seem a bit cumbersome compared to the standard signature request. Please know that we are actively working on finding more streamlined solutions as the technology evolves. Our goal is to blend top-notch security with ease of use, and we appreciate your understanding as we navigate these technical limitations.
