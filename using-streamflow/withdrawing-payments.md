# Claiming unlocked tokens

#### Manual claim tokens to your wallet

The recipient can easily withdraw their unlocked tokens from a vesting or payment contract into their wallet.

**Note:** Once the contract has completed, all remaining tokens will be claimed to the recipients wallet. &#x20;

**Step 1:** Visit the Streamflow app and select either **"Vesting"** or **"Payments"** &#x20;

#### Auto-claim tokens to your wallet

With **Auto-Claim** you can automate the need for the recipient to claim their tokens as they unlock. Instead the unlocked tokens are directly dropped into the recipients wallet. The sender will pay the fees for these transactions.&#x20;

_Please note:_ If the recipient's wallet address belongs to a centralized exchange, it is mandatory to activate Auto-Claim.&#x20;
