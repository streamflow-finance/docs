The powerful and configurable features of the Streamflow app let you progressively unlock payments to:

* Employees
* Freelancers
* Service providers&#x20;
* Contractors

Streamflow payment contracts come up with unique and configurable features that bring a ton of benefits for both the employer and the employees for example:&#x20;

1. Set the contracts to be cancellable for the sender
2. Transferrable for the recipient&#x20;
3. Activate auto-claim&#x20;

Ultimately these contracts can save you time and money by making your whole payroll system bankless and paperless, you only need a decentralized wallet account, funds, and the wallet addresses of employees to set up payroll contracts.
