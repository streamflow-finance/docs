# Multisig Beta

Streamflow’s multisig wallet beta is here and ready to service individuals and teams looking to establish a treasury gated by multiple private keys. We’ll be collecting feedback, adding additional features, and fixing bugs in the coming weeks as we run our Beta event.

For a detailed walk through to setup your first multisig with Streamflow you can find our tutorial [here](../help/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-multisig-beta-wallet.md).
